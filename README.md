**Fundamentals of flutter**
```
lib is our main working directory and it is where all our dart
files are located.
This is where we write all our business logic.

```

**Application structure**
```
The application begins with void main =>runApp() which takes in a root widget that is basically a class.

```

**Flutter concepts**
```
(a)Widgets take in properties .It may take in different properties both which are comma separated.

void main() => runApp(MaterialApp(
  home:Text('Caleb begins with flutter!'),
));

In the Example above MaterialApp is our root widget.

(b)Each widget has different properties..[key value pair of widgets where the
 key is the property.Thus flutter is a nest of widgets.
We have widgets as values of properties a lot of the time.

(c)Whenever you nest in a widget inside another widget it takes in the child property.

```

**Types of widgets**
```
(a)Scaffold widget.It is great in giving the layout structure of an application.
eg it can take in the appBar property
(b)Center widget centralizes whatever is placed inside of it.It may take in another
widget eg Text or any other widget.
